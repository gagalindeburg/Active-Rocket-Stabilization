# Active-Rocket-Stabilization

Right now, I'm just collecting examples of code for later implementation. 

High-powered rockets. My testbed is a 4-inch diameter rocket with a 54 mm motor mount tube. 

I will stick to Arduino-compatible code. I am an Arduino novice.

I am a skilled programmer, but I am currently completely unskilled in C and C++.

I am a multidisciplinary engineer, physycist, chemist, scientist. But, I have much to learn. Electronics is my weakest engineering skill.

There are three basic aerodynamic conditions to control: roll, pitch, and yaw.

There are five basic concepts that have been explored by others: active fins, thrust vectoring, reaction gas and pyro jets, reaction wheels, and drag/spoiler devices.

My first application will be with active fin control.

I will accumulate what I can find.
